        <p>By using our web sites, you signify that you agree with the terms of our current Privacy Policy as posted on
            our sites as well as our Terms of Use. If you do not agree with any term in this Policy or our Terms of Use,

        <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may also use Personal Information to keep track of a user's activities on our sites, to improve our
            marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze web site usage, to improve our web site
            features, design and content and to refine our marketing strategies. <br> <br>When you provide us with
            Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this
            Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information as described in this
            Policy. <br><br>The web site you entered may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party
            (e.g., the site might allow you to send an email or message to a friend, in which case we will need that
            person's name and email address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose
            (e.g., to deliver the email message) and we will not contact the third party again by email unless and until
            the third party contacts us.</p>
            <a id="py3"></a><br><br>
        <h2>The Way We Use Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We may also use Personal Information to contact you regarding Lexico products or promotions as well as other
            products and services, which may be requested by or otherwise of interest to you (including those we may
            offer jointly with other companies). At any time, however, you may opt out of such future contact by
            unsubscribing from our database. <br><br>We may also enhance your Personal Information by linking it to data
            obtained from third parties, such as non-personally identifiable information (e.g., demographic and
            geographic characteristics) as well as other publicly available data such as census information. Such
            enhanced information allows us to provide our users with a more customized experience. <br><br><b>Orhpee BD
                Ltd.</b> primary goal in collecting and using Personal Information is to give you a meaningful and

        <h2>Collection And Use Of Other Information; Use Of Cookies</h2>
        <p>You may have heard of "cookies," which are small files or pieces of information that are stored by your
            browser on your computer's hard drive when you visit a web site. The use of cookies is an industry standard
            and you will find them at most web sites. <b>Orhpee BD Ltd.</b> may use cookies to collect other information
            during your visit to our web sites, such as the particular site areas you visit and the activities in which
            you participate at our web sites. <b>Orhpee BD Ltd.</b> does not automatically collect any Personal
            Information, but we may combine non-personal information collected automatically (through cookies) with
            voluntarily submitted Personal Information. Such link may occur only if you provide <b>Orhpee BD Ltd.</b>
            with Personal Information on our sites. This practice allows <b>Orhpee BD Ltd.</b> to keep track of items
            such as sweepstakes participation, email and advertising interaction levels, survey responses, online coupon
            redemption and other web activity in order to better tailor our web sites and our products to your interests
            and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities at our web sites -- the computer
            can remember that you have already provided Personal Information to us and not request that you provide any
            a second time. <br><br>
            Anonymous information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number assigned to your computer
            whenever you surf the Internet), the type of Internet browser you are using, and the type of computer
            operating system you are using may also be collected by us using cookies. Web servers, the computers that
            "serve up" web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from
            this web site, our servers log your IP address. <br><br>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.
            If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Refusal of
            cookies at the site you entered may result in an inability to visit certain areas of the web sites or to
            receive personalized information when you visit the web sites.

        <h2>With Whom We May Share Information</h2>
        <p>In the course of doing business, we employ other companies to perform a variety of functions on our behalf.
            For example, at times we may retain third parties to analyze, update and correct data we collect on our web
            sites, including Personal Information, to help us improve our products, our database and our web sites. In
            addition, we may share Personal Information with agents, suppliers, fulfillment houses and other third
            parties to allow delivery of prizes, information, products or services. These suppliers and other third
            parties may have access to your Personal Information if it is needed to perform their functions for Duo
            Juice Company, but they are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any way other than the
            intended use. <br><br>
            We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers,
            business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. For example, we may tell a business partner the number
            of men and the number of women that entered a contest, but we do not disclose Personal Information about
            such contestants in violation of this Privacy Policy. <br><br>
            Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, transfer or disclose your Personal Information
            without your prior consent. <br><br>
            We may release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or
            court order, or to a third party to which ownership of PRAN Foods Ltd. is transferred via an acquisition,
            merger, sale of assets or otherwise.

        <h2>Data Protection And Security</h2>
        <p>We take commercially reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information secure. All access to the
            information we collect is subject to physical, electronic and managerial restrictions to prevent
            unauthorized access, modification or misuse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we cannot guarantee the security
            of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.
